# AI-Spider-Web-Crawler

Great, thanks for the clarifications. Now, we'll proceed to the Method section, detailing the architecture, tools, and technologies that will be used to develop the AI spider and web crawler. I'll also incorporate PostgreSQL for data storage as specified.

```asciidoc
= SPEC-001: Intelligent AI Spider and Web Crawler
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The purpose of this project is to develop an intelligent AI spider and web crawler using Python to index and collect data from websites containing documentations and tutorials. The AI spider will focus on extracting text and PDF files from all available pages within the specified domain, ensuring comprehensive data collection.

== Requirements

*Objective:*
- Index and collect data from specified domains.

*Target Domain:*
- Websites containing documentations and tutorials.

*Data Type:*
- Extract text and PDF files.

*Scope and Depth:*
- Navigate and collect data from all pages within the specified domain.

*Frequency:*
- The crawler will be run manually as needed.

*Specific Features:*
- Handle JavaScript content.
- All crawled pages should be available for download as PDF files.

*Output Format:*
- Store collected data in a database.
- Options to download the data in CSV or JSON format.

*Technical Requirements:*
- Python-based implementation.
- Effective handling of JavaScript for dynamic content.
- Capability to download and save crawled pages as PDFs.
- Storage of extracted data in PostgreSQL with optional CSV or JSON downloads.
```

### Method

Let's outline the architecture and the specific tools and libraries to use for this project.

@startuml
actor User
User -> WebCrawler : Start Crawl
WebCrawler -> PageFetcher : Fetch Page
PageFetcher -> JavaScriptHandler : Handle JS
JavaScriptHandler -> PageFetcher : Return Processed Page
PageFetcher -> ContentExtractor : Extract Text and PDFs
ContentExtractor -> DatabaseHandler : Save to PostgreSQL
User -> DatabaseHandler : Request Data (CSV/JSON)
DatabaseHandler -> User : Provide Data (CSV/JSON)

=== Tools and Libraries

* **Python Libraries:**
  - `requests` and `httpx`: For making HTTP requests.
  - `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML content.
  - `PyMuPDF` or `pdfminer.six`: For handling and extracting content from PDFs.
  - `selenium` or `playwright`: For handling JavaScript content and dynamic pages.
  - `sqlalchemy`: For database ORM with PostgreSQL.
  - `pdfkit` or `weasyprint`: For saving crawled pages as PDFs.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and exporting to CSV/JSON.

* **Database:**
  - `PostgreSQL`: For storing extracted data.

=== Component Details

1. **WebCrawler:**
   - This component will orchestrate the crawling process, manage the list of URLs to crawl, and handle retries in case of failures.

2. **PageFetcher:**
   - Responsible for fetching the raw HTML content of the pages.

3. **JavaScriptHandler:**
   - Uses `selenium` or `playwright` to process JavaScript-heavy pages and return the rendered HTML.

4. **ContentExtractor:**
   - Parses the fetched HTML to extract text and PDFs. Uses libraries like `beautifulsoup4` for HTML and `PyMuPDF` for PDFs.

5. **DatabaseHandler:**
   - Manages connections to the PostgreSQL database, inserts extracted data, and handles data queries for CSV/JSON export.

=== Database Schema

----
@startuml
entity "Documents" {
  * id: UUID [PK]
  * url: VARCHAR
  * title: VARCHAR
  * content: TEXT
  * pdf_link: VARCHAR
  * crawled_at: TIMESTAMP
}
@enduml
----

* `Documents` Table:
  - `id`: Primary key, unique identifier for each document.
  - `url`: URL of the crawled page.
  - `title`: Title of the document/page.
  - `content`: Extracted text content.
  - `pdf_link`: URL to the PDF file if available.
  - `crawled_at`: Timestamp when the page was crawled.

```

### Questions:
1. Do you prefer `selenium` or `playwright` for handling JavaScript content?
2. Would you like any specific features or optimizations included in the crawling process?

After this, we will proceed to the Implementation section, providing detailed steps to build and run the solution.


To create an intelligent AI spider and web crawler, you can use Python and various libraries like BeautifulSoup4 for parsing HTML content, requests library to fetch the URLs, Pyppeteer for handling JavaScript content, and Tika for converting HTML to PDF files. Here's a high-level overview of how to approach this project:

1. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pyppeteer tika
   ```
2. Create a Python script using the following code as a starting point:

   ```python
   import requests
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
   from pyppeteer import launch
   
   def get_page_html(url):
       # Fetch the HTML content of the webpage and return it
       
   def convert_to_pdf(html, file_name):
       # Use Tika to convert HTML to PDF
       
   def main():
       url = "https://example.com"  # Replace this with the URL you want to crawl
       html = get_page_html(url)
       pdf_file = convert_to_pdf(html, "output.pdf")
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```
3. Use BeautifulSoup4 to parse the HTML content of each webpage and extract the text you need. You can use BeautifulSoup's `find` or `select` methods to find specific elements on the page, such as headers or paragraphs.

4. For handling JavaScript-heavy websites, use Pyppeteer to render the page and get the HTML content using a headless browser. Here's an example:
   ```python
   async def get_page_html(url):
       async with launch() as browser:
           page = await browser.newPage()
           await page.goto(url)
           html = await page.content()
           return html
   ```
5. Use Tika to convert the HTML content to a PDF file and save it locally or upload it to a cloud storage service like Amazon S3 for long-term storage.
6. Store the collected data in a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL) using a library like Pymongo or SQLAlchemy for easy querying and retrieval.
7. Implement a function to download the data as CSV or JSON format, either by creating a new script or modifying your `main` function.

This is just a starting point; you can customize the code according to your specific requirements and use case. Let me know if you have any questions!
