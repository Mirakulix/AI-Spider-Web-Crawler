# For handling JavaScript-heavy websites, use Pyppeteer to render the page and get the HTML content using a headless browser. Here's an example:
async def get_page_html(url):
     async with launch() as browser:
         page = await browser.newPage()
         await page.goto(url)
         html = await page.content()
         return html

def get_page_html(url):
   # Fetch the HTML content of the webpage and return it
   
def convert_to_pdf(html, file_name):
   # Use Tika to convert HTML to PDF
   
def main():
   url = "https://example.com"  # Replace this with the URL you want to crawl
   html = get_page_html(url)
   pdf_file = convert_to_pdf(html, "output.pdf")

if __name__ == "__main__":
   main()
  
# Use BeautifulSoup4 to parse the HTML content of each webpage and extract the text you need. You can use BeautifulSoup's `find` or `select` methods to find specific elements on the page, such as headers or paragraphs.
